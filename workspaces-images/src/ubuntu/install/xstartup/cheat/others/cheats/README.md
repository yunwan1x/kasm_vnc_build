Cheatsheets for [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi).

When the user runs navi for the first time, navi prompts to download `.cheat`s from this repository.

If you want to add a cheatsheet for a new command, it's worth checking out [navi-tldr-pages](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi-tldr-pages). You can copy a cheatsheet from there, enhance it —with argument suggestions, for example—, then add it to this repo.

In order to add your own repository as a featured cheatsheet repo, please [edit this file](https://github.com/denisidoro/cheats/edit/master/featured_repos.txt). This list will be displayed when `navi repo browse` is run.
